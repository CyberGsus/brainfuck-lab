# brainfuck testing

This is my lab for experimentation with brainfuck. Currently I have:

- [bf](./bf.c), a very simple interpreter for brainfuck written in C.
- [bf-hs](./bf-hs), a more sophisticated interpreter written in Haskell, inspired in the one which appears in [this article](https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/master/write_yourself_a_brainfuck.md).
- [b2bf](./b2bf), a very silly program which gets input from file or stdin and outputs a brainfuck program which when executed will output those bytes, comes with code size optimization phases.
