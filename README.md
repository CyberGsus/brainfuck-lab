# brainfuck testing

This is my lab for experimentation with brainfuck. Currently I have:

- [bf](./bf.c), a very simple interpreter for brainfuck written in C.
- [bf-hs](./bf-hs), a more sophisticated interpreter written in Haskell, inspired in the one which appears in [this article](https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/master/write_yourself_a_brainfuck.md).
- [str2brainfuck](./str2brainfuck.c), an utility which takes strings as arguments and spits a brainfuck program to print them in the console.
